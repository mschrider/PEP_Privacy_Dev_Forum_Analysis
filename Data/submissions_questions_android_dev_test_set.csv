androiddev,t3_c76ix2,Allow Wi-Fi Multicast Reception!,"Firstly im not a dev or anything at all about programming or making apps im just looking for a answer to a question if anyone would be kind enough to answer in the most simplistic terms.

Recently I've been interested in a app its a drum app a very good drum app but the dev has set dodgy permissions like allowing camera access and gps location which doesn't make sense at all for a Drum app! 

Those i can block the permissions too on android but there's a permission i cannot block called Allow Reception of Wi-Fi Multicast which from the few descriptions ive read online as non app developer and looking at the other nonsensical permissions seem very suspicious! 

So please could somebody possibly explain this permission like im a 5 year old and tell me if its safe?

androiddev,t3_owyxch,ViewModel and Fragment,"I have a couple of questions regarding viewmodel and fragment as I couldn't find my answers online.

Let's assume we have a fragment and inside of it we do:

     private val viewModel by viewModels<UsersViewModel>()

As I understood, here we use the extension method `viewModels()` which will create an instance of the class `UsersViewModel` ....  So let's say in the `UsersViewModel` I have:

        private val userLiveData = MutableLiveData<MutableList<UserResponse>>()
        private val dataStatusLiveData = MutableLiveData<Int>()
    
    
        fun getUsers(): MutableLiveData<MutableList<UserResponse>> {
            return userLiveData
        }
    
        fun getDataStatus(): MutableLiveData<Int> {
            return dataStatusLiveData
        }
    
     init {
            loadUsers()
        }
    
        private fun loadUsers() {
            viewModelScope.launch {
                dataStatusLiveData.postValue(View.VISIBLE)
                    val users = repository.fetchAllUsers()
                    when (users.isSuccessful) {
                        true -> {
                            if (users.body() != null) {
                                usersLiveData.postValue(countries.body())
                                dataStatusLiveData.postValue(View.GONE)
                            }
                        }
                        else -> {
                            dataStatusLiveData.postValue(1)
                        }
                }
            }
        }

And in Fragment I have:

        private fun setUpUserList() {
            adapter = usersView.adapter as UserAdapter
            viewModel.getUser().observe(viewLifecycleOwner, { userList ->
                adapter.setUserList(userList)
                })
            observeStatus()
            }
    
        private fun observeStatus() {
            viewModel.getDataStatus().observe(viewLifecycleOwner, { status ->
                when(status){
                    0 -> {
                        progressBar.visibility = View.VISIBLE
                    }
                    8 -> {
                        progressBar.visibility = View.GONE
                    }
                    1 -> {
                        Toast.makeText(context,getString(R.string.errorMsg),Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
                    }
                }
            })
        }

&#x200B;

1. When this is called  `private val viewModel by viewModels<UsersViewModel>()`  does it call the `init` block since it's creating an instance of it? Or when `getUser().observe(..)`  does it call the `init` block and observes the data?
2. Inside `loadUsers` I'm using a `liveData` for status and for the data I'm getting from the web service. If let's say I comment this call `observeStatus()`  in fragment, why doesnt `getDataStatus()` observe the status?",1

androiddev,t3_l1whsa,"How to dynamically update a Recycler View item from network while in is in view? Eg. Number of likes, comments in a Tweet","Hey , I was wondering how to update data in Recyclers dynamically in the most efficient way,like in  the App twitter Each tweet will have number of retweets , likes etc changing by the time the specific tweet is in view.    

So how would you update those items in the recycler with the latest number of likes ?

To add more complexity, how would you then handle if the user presses ""Like"" and now you'd have to send a network request which probably will return the latest number of likes and now you'd need to update the number of likes of only that specific tweet.   

I am trying to accomplish this using flows api, any ideas/suggestions/ Open source projects  will be helpful.

What software do I need to install for this to function properly? What steps should I take to ensure that the ADB file is recognized by the Emulator?  I have installed the ADB server and updated my Windows Environment Variables.

androiddev,t3_9qplgc,Should a ViewModel observe another ViewModel?,"Suppose I have a “wizard”/“workflow” where an activity hosts multiple successive fragments (perhaps through a ViewPager or the Navigation component). There exists an ActivityViewModel (mostly for navigation), as well as a FragmentOneViewModel, a FragmentTwoViewModel, a FragmentThreeViewModel, etc.

If conditional navigation is dependent on data from multiple fragments in the flow, how does the ActivityViewModel become aware of changes in the fragments’ data? Using the activity as a passthrough object seems wrong, because it means the activity sees things it doesn’t care about (or shouldn’t know about), and it means making changes in more than one place if the ActivityViewModel needs access to a new piece of information in the flow.

Is there anything wrong with the ActivityViewModel “observing” the LiveData of the fragments’ ViewModels (i.e. the activity ultimately observes a LiveData from the ActivityViewModel, which comes from LiveData transformations)? This seems like the cleanest way to expose only the minimum necessary data to each component in the architecture.

This is assuming all of the ViewModels are scoped to the lifetime of the activity. ",1

androiddev,t3_xw500x,Text-to-speech working intermittently when screen is off?,"I have an application that works with a companion device. There's a constant connection between the two, and everything works correctly - however, text-to-speech (TTS) does not.

In this case, TTS should be invoked at specific intervals (say, once every minute). When the screen is off and phone is not connected, TTS works only for a while. After that, it starts to queue up the TTS utterances, usually playing once it has two messages queued up, but in some cases, it queues them up until screen is turned back on, uttering all the messages in sequence.

I've investigated this quite a bit, but haven't found any solutions. I wrote a log-to-file utility to log stuff because connecting to adb makes the issue go away. Based on my logging, the app code works as intended even when the utterances start to be delayed. textToSpeech.speak() is invoked correctly, it's just that sound doesn't come out.

The only thing I've noticed is that utterance progress listener gets invoked correctly when speech is done normally (onSpeakStart first, onSpeakStop after utterance), but in the problem case, only onSpeakStart gets invoked. After that, nothing happens until the next message that may or may not trigger the speech once again. In this case, onSpeakStart is invoked again, but not onSpeakStop gets also invoked correctly.

My reasoning here is that the TTS service gets put down by Doze, but there's no way to affect this. The app is working correctly through Doze and whatnot, it's only the TTS invocation that stops working after a while.",1

androiddev,t3_cd6d7o,Object creation syntax in Java.,"Hello! I've been working on super simple apps on Android lately, and I notice in the tutorials I've seen, the object creation syntax for Java is kinda different to what I've learnt in books?


For example, this Java code to display a message on Android:-




    public void displayMessage(String message) {

        TextView messageTextView = findViewById(R.id.Price_text_view);
        messageTextView.setText(message);

    }




An object of TextView was created with this syntax:



```        TextView messageTextView = findViewById(R.id.Price_text_view);```



But this looks new to me, is this just another way of typing:


```TextView messageTextView = new TextView();```


```TextView.findViewById(R.id.Price_text_view);```




?



If that's the case, then the second version of the object creation actually doesn't work... it's expecting me to put something in the parameters of TextView and I can't for the life of me figure out what it is.

This is a new account to announce one of the Android library projects we are hoping to launch in the coming months from within Thomson Reuters.

RippleDecoratorView is a widget library with a view used to wrap any of your layouts. It allows you, for any touch, to add animations effects such as: ripple stroke, ripple fill, highlight, and zoom. These animations come with a configurable fade-in, fade-out timeline.

It does not capture touches, so you can pepper it safely though your XML layout files.

It comes with an example project and is already available at Maven Central.

Github Repository: https://github.com/thomsonreuters/RippleDecoratorView

And if you want a q&d introduction, just add to your dependencies

    compile 'com.thomsonreuters:rippledecoratorview:+'

and wrap any of your views with

    <com.thomsonreuters.rippledecoratorview.RippleDecoratorView

androiddev,t3_qd51cz,SaveInstanceState. Do you use it?,"Practically speaking, if you are using viewmodel, the only use case for save instance state is to handle system initiated process death.

On iOS most apps when you come back after prolonged period of time, it starts in a fresh state. And many android app is the same.

If you want to implement handling system initiated process death, you’d better implement it for majority of your app.

For example, 
Activity A - activity B - activity C.
If you want to handle it for activity C, most likely you want to handle it for activity B. If you don’t, your activity C is recreated and you press back button your activity B could be in an inconsistent state.

Practically how many of you actually even care to handle system initiated process death. It’s so much work for little gain and UX impact.

Often times large complex app is really complex, and handling this for most activities and app wise states is just impractical. Also for large custom object, you need custom parcel logic…

“For the truly desperate, you could do a check for a process death in the “OnCreate()” method of all your activities, and then re-launch your launcher activity.”",1

androiddev,t3_tpiue2,Android Compose advantages over XML,"I am well verse working with XML including custom views for years, I created a module of delegate class which can improve the development and avoid writing boilerplate.

I wanna know stuff like can we also use Kotlin extension with Compose just like with regular View. What are the advantages and limitation as of 2022? Is it platform independent as well? What are the untold truth about Compose? Do we already have best practice or pattern to follow when using Compose? Answer based on actual experience is probably what I am looking for.

I would like to use recommended AAB instead of APK and for that, I need Google Play Store. I created dev account and have access to GPS.

2. How do I connect Firebase Android App with GPS? I can't seem to find any kind of set up in GPS where it'd ask me for package ID.

androiddev,t3_33n9jg,Introducing Ironhide! An Android user interface automation framework.,"Hey all Android programmers! Would you like to run your entire test suite with a push of a button? Then check out Ironhide!


# [Check out Ironhide!](http://mindbody.github.io/Ironhide/)


# What is Ironhide?
Ironhide is an Opensource Object Oriented Android testing framework, written in Java, built on top of the Google Espresso testing framework. Ironhide provides an easier to use framework by handling some of the more complex elements of Espresso and Hamcrest matchers in the background, and providing the user with an easy way to create tests.


# Why should I use Ironhide?
You might be asking yourself ""Why would I need this testing suite?"" You might say ""I can manually test my app as I go."" However, think of Ironhide in this way: If you had a button that you could press that said to you “everything is good with the app” or “something is wrong” how often would you press that button? Every time before you release? Every time before you commit? Why not every time you build! Ironhide offers this tool, a magic button to push after you make a change to see if everything still works. Ironhide is a way to both quickly write up and run a test for your new feature, and then keep your tests in a full test suite to check functionality.


On top of offering developers a way to include test driven development into their development cycles, Ironhide can make your Quality Assurance testing much easier. Often QA testing at the end of a development cycle can take a while, maybe even an entire day. Creating a suite of smoke tests that test your apps basic functionality can make everyone’s lives easier, and give you more time to find the bugs in your new features. Ironhide makes this happen by giving you tests that are easy to write, and more importantly easy to read. With a test suite thats easy to run and tell what broke when it fails, Ironhide can help cut down on your QA time significantly.


It’s not uncommon for bug lists to be 100 or more bugs long! Many times this happens because rigorous testing only happening at the end of the development cycle. Without an easy way to test, developers just don’t have the time to manually test every time they commit a change. When bugs are only found at the stage before release, often there is not enough time to fix those bugs before they go out into production. In most of these cases the use of the magic button Ironhide could solve this issue. If testing is happening at every stage of development the number of bugs that come up in QA testing is significantly reduced. In an ideal world, QA should run through their test suite and come back saying “It’s all good, no bugs were found.” Now of course this isn’t always, if ever, going to happen, but Ironhide can help you get close!",0

androiddev,t3_ammlln,Need help with Camera2 API,"**What I need**: An app that will capture multiple RAW images with predefined exposure and ISO settings, and store them with a custom name, with a button click. 

**What I found**:

- To get RAW images, I would need to use Camera2 API, which doesn't have a lot of learning material. 
- Google Samples on GitHub has this [repository](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-Camera2Raw) which is a basic way to get RAW and JPEG images.
- Within the code, I found setup3AControlsLocked method, which basically sets up the 3As, which are Auto Exposure, Auto Focus and Auto White Balance. 
- Since I need to toggle exposure, I turned off only Auto Exposure, but my resultant images had different ISO than what I had set. I tried turning off all the 3As, yet I wasn't able to perfectly get what I wanted.
- I suspect that this is due to me calling the takePicture method before the previous one had finished (because of callbacks I think).

**Questions**:

- How do I wait for the previous takePicture to finish?
- Is there another way to do this instead of calling takePicture multiple times?

androiddev,t3_9eh2o9,Is Android Studio really buggy?,"I started the Google Udacity Android Development course a few months ago and felt that I wasn't really understanding a lot of the content and left it. Anyway, I've now studied a bit of Java and gained a lot more understanding about programming generally so I thought I'd have another go with the Udacity course.

I downloaded Android Studio afresh and I can't seem to get anything to work! After downloading the git repo for the course and the same project which was working fine before, now seems to be totally inoperable. I'm getting `Cannot Resolve Symbol`  messages for all of the recycleViews, despite this being in the list of imports. When I run this on the emulator, the app seems to work perfectly.

I tried to look for other tutorials and when I was playing around with constraintLayout, none of the elements would show up on the preview screen. I changed the theme and then it became visible. Now I don't know enough to say definitively that this is a bug but I distinctly remember things working much better in my last foray into Android development.

StackOverflow seems to be full of people with similar issues to me and a lot of people suggest making changes to the gradle manifests. I've implemented all of these but nothing has totally resolved the issues that I'm facing.

androiddev,t3_bt7928,Protecting pet project identity,"Hi!

I'm making an app with a friend, and we hired a UI-designer who designed a very nice looking UI for us, including app icon, simple ""design language"" for app's UI components etc.

What worries me now a bit is that as soon as we publish the UI-update, anyone with malicious intent will be able to simply decompile the app and steal icon, images, maybe even whole app look can be replicated with our resources by someone else.

I was thinking of ways to protect our app (maybe registering a trademark since even the app's name is not registered anywhere else outside of Play Market), but then I started to doubt - is it worth it? Is there even a tiny possibility that someone would look at our tiny app (which has only a couple of installs) and would think: ""hey, they have a nice design, let's steal it""?

Do you try to somehow protect your pet project app's identity? Or maybe Play Market protects it automatically, accepting complaints about thief-apps even if you don't register any trademark anywhere?",1

 I have an arraylist of strings that will consists of URI's, and i want to do an intent to open those URI's with gallery.

Here is the code for the method:

     public void btnChoosePhotosClick(View v){

        ArrayList<String> selectedItems = imageAdapter.getCheckedItems();
        Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, ""Total photos selected:      ""+selectedItems.size(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();

androiddev,t3_9f9bdd,Project that is injecting all the views from xml in each Activity/Fragment with dagger.,"Hello,

I've ended up with a project that uses dagger, nothing out of the ordinary, except one thing. It turns out that every view from the xml gets injected via a Daggermodule.

Basically every activity has a module, when created in the activity/fragment, the module gets the activity passed in and then there is a ton of @Provides, one for each and every view from the xml that gets used by the activity/fragment. Every provides method is a ""return activity.findViewById(ID)"" and are differentiated with a @Named annotation to separate them. Final thing that happens is theese views gets injected into a separate class that handles dispalying the data (setting the text, setting clicklisteners etc etc..

Hopefully you kinda get the idea (I've only been able to take a small look on the actual code so i haven't been able to dig up all the specifics) 

Seeing this left me with a bad taste in my mouth. First of all the amount of boilerplate you have to write for every view you need to inject, but also, wouldnt this skyrocket the methodcount really fast?

Am i missing something good here? I tried finding anything on the internet validating this as something good but i had a hard time really finding anything on this subject at all. The only thing i found was this thread [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20821148/difference-between-dagger-and-butterknife-android) where in the comments, Jake Wharton, bolster my idea that this is something bad. Specifically stating that using dagger to inject views will lead to a bad time.

Except for the bad things i stated above, do i have to worry on even more things?
Do anyone here see this as a valid or atleast feasible solution that can explain what i am missing.",1

androiddev,t3_cw7bl0,Question about the play store dev account,"Hello fellow android devs, I need an advice from you, I am in the situation where I have got two strikes in my developer account, which I opened 8 months ago to make an app for a client. The app in question was a webview of a site i developed, for my client, but his business was cannabis related (which is legal in my country). I know a webview is bad, I had time constrain and was in a rush to publish. Big mistake. At first I thought the strike was related to content rating, but google updated his policy and there they said don't allow selling anything cannabis related. ok. My webview had a shopping cart feature, It made sense.
So after that I pretended to make him a very simple app, basic feature, all native, no shopping cart whatsoever and it is almost ready. But I am terrified to publish it.

Question number one: as I have two strikes, I made my client open his dev account to upload there the app and test it before publishing (another mistake I did, I went straight to production).  Is this the safest way for me to not receive the third strike? Our account are connected, as I can upload the apk on his account.
As I imagine, the strike, if any, will go to his account.

Question number two: as I don't have any app published on my account, I was thinking to close it. But do you think guys if one day I re open it it will still be there with the two strikes ?

Thank you for any advice you can give me.",1

androiddev,t3_d3srkg,"How do I save files (photos, mostly) to the device's (real one or emulator) internal memory?","I'm new to android, so pardon if this question might sound noobish.

Now, I understand that, android only has two types of storage (according to the documentation, paraphrased as follows):

1. ""Internal Storage"" : app-only access, can't be seen by other apps and the user
2. ""External Storage"" : world-readable (other apps and the user), can be the SD card

My app requires that the user can see the image files, and consequently transfer them to a computer or whatever. So, ""Internal Storage"" is a no-go, so my question is

Can I save it in the ""External Storage"", and always expect it to be saved to the **internal memory** of the phone, and **not** in the SD card? (I mean, nowadays, internal phone memory is huge; also, Android Q's scoped storage, how do?)

androiddev,t3_c57df3,Best method to detect adblockers?,"Hey everyone!

So my todo list for today was to see if there's a way to detect adblockers in an android app. After a bit of googling it appears that one popular method for adblockers is to edit the /etc/hosts file and redirect any ad requests (like requests going to [admob.com](https://admob.com)) towards [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) (pretty similar to what is done on PC to crack paid apps).

So a naive way to detect if an adblocker is present is to check that hosts file (which is publicly readable) to see if there's any suspicious redirect to [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) (except for the normal [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) localhost line). 

However this seems a bit too easy to me, so I have two questions:

* Is there any reason for a redirect to [127.0.0.1](https://127.0.0.1) to be present in /etc/hosts other than adblocking? 
* Are there any other methods for adblocking? AFAIK writing /etc/hosts requires root privilege, but I think I've heard of adblocking apps that do not require root. Anyone know how they work?

If anyone has any more information on how to reliably detect adblockers, I'm all ears!",1

My personal experience is like this:


1. I reported a small bug in Navigation Component, which was easy for them to fix, they fixed it and I got an answer in like 2 days.


2. I reported a bug also in Navigation Component, 3 weeks no update.


3. I was having problems with Paging Library, found out more people have the same problems. There are a couple of issues on their IssueTracker. One of them is from 2017 and was closed as ""Won't fix"" because as they say it's not a problem of the Library but of the RecyclerView. Another one is open for like one year without any update from Google.






For example number 3 is really causing an issue in my project and I don't know what should I do, should I wait for a ""possible"" update or should I look into other Implementations without Paging Library. When looking at Paging Library Issues, it looks like it is abandoned, a lot of open bugs and feature requests without updates. As they said that it's a RecyclerView problem, I created another issue but already for RecyclerView, but Google doesn't seem to be active there as well. 






So correct me if I am wrong. For me bug reporting is like helping developers create a better product. So how can I be motivated to report bugs if I'm not getting any feedback? If the bug is not in your product but from other team just close it as in case Nr. 3? Seriously? Why not notify the other team about it or move it to their board?

See the **References** section below for the practice of ""associated account bans"" by Google, and the leveraging of lifetime bans on developers to push them to support apps which have been unpublished (developers cannot remove/delete apps themselves).

Saw this news story today:

- [Thousands of YouTubers want to unionize, and they’ve got the support of Europe’s largest trade union](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/06/youtubers-want-to-unionize-and-theyve-got-the-support-of-ig-metall.html)

This move in Germany was started by that famous German slingshot maker on YouTube:

>Jörg Sprave is a YouTuber based in Germany who builds and tests extreme slingshots and crossbows.
>
>Sprave started the YouTubers Union Facebook group in March 2018 as a place for dissatisfied creators to gather and organize against YouTube’s new advertising rules. The group now has over 20,000 members.
>
>Sprave’s took his efforts to the next level in July, when the YouTubers Union partnered with IG Metall to start the FairTube campaign. IG Metall is a German union founded in 1949 with over 2 million members, making it Europe’s largest trade union.
>
>YouTube has pushed back against FairTube and IG Metall’s claims of unfair treatment. “We’re deeply invested in creators’ success,” a YouTube spokesperson told CNBC Make It. “We also need to ensure that users feel safe and that advertisers feel confident that YouTube is safe for their brand. We take lots of feedback as we work to get this balance right.”
>
>Still, FairTube is not backing down on its demands for change at the company, and it has set a deadline of August 23, 2019 for YouTube to come to the negotiating table.
>
>FairTube’s demands for YouTube include:
>    Transparency in decisions surrounding demonetization
>    A direct line of communication to a company representative
>    An independent board to resolve disputes between creators and YouTube
>    A YouTubers advisory board where creators can weigh in on company decisions
>
>“YouTube calls the YouTubers ‘partners,’ but in reality that’s not the case,” Sprave said in a video announcing the campaign. **“YouTube has all the power, and this is not how a partnership works.”**
>
>One method is claiming that YouTubers are actually employees of YouTube and not self-employed like the company claims. **“There is some evidence that YouTubers may be falsely self-employed. For example, they are continuously rated and monitored by YouTube, and only YouTube managers the relationship with advertisers,”** said IG Metall lawyer Thomas Klebe in a video announcing the partnership.
>
>FairTube is also considering appealing to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect last year. **GDPR states that individuals have a right to request a copy of their personal data collected by companies. FairTube claims that YouTube’s decisions about whether or not to place ads on individual videos fall under this umbrella, and that data should be made available to YouTubers as part of GDPR.**

**Google as Reseller vs. middleman/partner - for android developers**

The analogy with a Walmart maybe illustrative - they too resell products, and retain the right to carry a certain product or drop it.

However, the difference here may be that - for example with apps on Google Play - the apps and their sales are not represented as being re-sold by Google (correct me if I am wrong), but as partners.

Although I do not know how the gradual move from Google not charging taxes, to now steadily being responsible for tax deductions for some countries is moving it towards a more Google-managed state.

I am forgetting what Apple calls it's relationship with developers (perhaps someone can comment on this) - whether Apple considers itself as a reseller, or as a middleman/partner - since they have a closer lock on app quality monitoring before submission (something Google is now moving towards - although much more automated than Apple it seems).

&nbsp;

**'Right to be forgotten' for developers**

That last paragraph is interesting - as something similar befalls developers in their interactions with Google.  Often there is a lack of context for Google communications, and more alarmingly a lack of context for app bans or developer account bans (including in the cases with ""associated account bans"").

The textbook case of the wife being banned for the crimes of the husband - a lifetime ban from Google that would survive divorce - has previously raised the question of whether the ""right to be forgotten"" laws could be relevant to such cases.  For example if the husband divorced, and forgets the wife, but Google does not forget her previous association with that spouse.  This seems like a classic case of ""right to be forgotten"".

**References:**

Google's practice of lifetime bans for android developers - bans which percolate from acquaintance to acquaintance.  In all likelihood a wife would face an immediate ban if her husband has already been banned - this association would survive divorce:

This looks an awful lot like forced labor (with lifetime account ban as leverage/threat):

androiddev,t3_5ag3wl,Demoing an app in a presentation - best (free) way?,"I'll need to demo an app to a room of people. Here's what I've tried so far:

* Mobizen: Wifi works but super laggy with a large delay, USB connection will not work
* Airdroid : Same as Mobizen with a wifi connection, the wifi connection is very delayed and choppy
* Vysor : Lag is greatly reduced, but the quality is abysmal unless you buy the paid version
* AS Emulator : Suffers from many of the same lag problems

Is there any way to mirror my screen via a USB connection that will basically have a clear picture and minimal delay? ",1
