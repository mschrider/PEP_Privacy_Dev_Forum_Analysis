## Project Description
Reddit covers various software development topics. In this project, you are expected to first
conduct a literature review on the current approaches and results related to the analysis of
developersâ€™ forums and discuss their results, and their shortcomings. Then propose an
improvement to the current approaches to create insights about the concerns and privacy
challenges of developers on Reddit. You are expected to extract information about developers'
questions related to regulations; privacy engineering practices; the solutions proposed by other
developers; the most answered questions; and the most accepted/rejected answers, etc. You will
also examine what the trends of questions or answers are pre- vs post-GDPR, CCPA and other
similar regulations and then report the results. You are expected to at least evaluate 100 Q/As in
the last five years. In addition to the paper, you are expected to make your dataset, tool, all other
relevant artifacts available on GitHub.
